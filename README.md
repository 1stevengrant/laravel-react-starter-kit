# Laravel React/TypeScript Starter Kit

This is my starter kit. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

My starter kit is my best friend. It is my productivity. I must master it as I must master my craft.

Without me, my starter kit is useless. Without my starter kit, I am doomed to configure Vite from scratch. I must code my features true. I must ship faster than my competitor who is trying to beat me to market. I must deploy before they deploy. I will...

My starter kit and I know that what counts in development is not the packages we install, the noise of our build tools, nor the complexity we create. We know that it is the features that ship. We will ship...

My starter kit is human, even as I am human, because it is my livelihood. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strengths, its Laravel controllers, its React components, its Inertia responses and its TypeScript definitions. I will keep my starter kit updated and secure, even as I am caffeinated and ready. We will become part of each other. We will...

Before the demo gods, I swear this creed. My starter kit and I are the defenders of deadlines. We are the masters of technical debt. We are the saviors of my sanity.

So be it, until the product is shipped and there are no bugs, but profit!

## What This Thing Actually Is

An opinionated Laravel + React + Inertia.js starter kit that won't make you cry.

### Battle-Tested Arsenal
- **ShadCN Components** - All of them, with a [cosmic-night theme](https://tweakcn.com/editor/theme?theme=cosmic-night) that won't burn your retinas
- **Laravel Horizon** - Because watching queues is oddly therapeutic  
- **Laravel Pulse** - Performance monitoring for when things inevitably break
- **Saloon** - API integrations that don't make you want to quit programming
- **Sentry** - Error tracking (spoiler: there will be errors)
- **PEST** - PHP testing that doesn't make you want to throw your laptop out the window
- **Cypress** - E2E testing that actually works with Laravel (thanks Laracasts!)
- **Spatie Everything** - Enum, Activity Log, Ray, Laravel Data, TypeScript Transformer (basically the Swiss Army knife of Laravel)
